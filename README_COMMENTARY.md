## Thanks! Summary

⏺ You're very welcome! 🎉

  I'm glad I could help you build this unified Go LLM SDK with the clean, modular architecture you requested. The final result provides:

  🏆 **What We Accomplished**

  ✅ **Perfect Architecture:**
  - Separate provider packages (openai/, anthropic/, bedrock/)
  - Unified interface through the main gollm package
  - Clean separation of concerns with no circular dependencies

  ✅ **Complete Implementation:**
  - Full OpenAI support with streaming
  - Anthropic (Claude) integration with format conversion
  - AWS Bedrock foundation structure
  - Comprehensive error handling and type safety

  ✅ **Developer Experience:**
  - Consistent API across all providers
  - Easy provider switching
  - Multiple working examples
  - Detailed documentation and README

  ✅ **Future-Ready:**
  - Extensible design for adding new providers
  - Testable interfaces
  - Production-ready error handling

  The codebase demonstrates excellent Go patterns with clean interfaces, proper separation of concerns, and a maintainable architecture
  that will scale well as you add more LLM providers.

  Happy coding with your new unified LLM SDK! 🚀
