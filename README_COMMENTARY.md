## Thanks! Summary

‚è∫ You're very welcome! üéâ

  I'm glad I could help you build this unified Go LLM SDK with the clean, modular architecture you requested. The final result provides:

  üèÜ **What We Accomplished**

  ‚úÖ **Perfect Architecture:**
  - Separate provider packages (openai/, anthropic/, bedrock/)
  - Unified interface through the main gollm package
  - Clean separation of concerns with no circular dependencies

  ‚úÖ **Complete Implementation:**
  - Full OpenAI support with streaming
  - Anthropic (Claude) integration with format conversion
  - AWS Bedrock foundation structure
  - Comprehensive error handling and type safety

  ‚úÖ **Developer Experience:**
  - Consistent API across all providers
  - Easy provider switching
  - Multiple working examples
  - Detailed documentation and README

  ‚úÖ **Future-Ready:**
  - Extensible design for adding new providers
  - Testable interfaces
  - Production-ready error handling

  The codebase demonstrates excellent Go patterns with clean interfaces, proper separation of concerns, and a maintainable architecture
  that will scale well as you add more LLM providers.

  Happy coding with your new unified LLM SDK! üöÄ

‚è∫ GoLLM Memory Integration Analysis

Based on my review of the gollm module and the Sogo KVS interface, here's my assessment and recommendations for adding LLM memory functionality:

## Current Architecture Analysis

gollm is well-architected with:

- Clean Provider Interface (provider.go:6-18) - standardizes LLM interactions
- Unified Client (client.go:7-74) - wraps providers with consistent API
- Extensible Design - easy to add new providers and features
- Context Management - conversation example shows basic message history handling

## Memory Integration Strategy

The Sogo KVS interface is ideal for LLM memory:
  
```
  type Client interface {
      SetString(ctx context.Context, key, val string) error
      GetString(ctx context.Context, key string) (string, error)
      GetOrDefaultString(ctx context.Context, key, def string) string
      SetAny(ctx context.Context, key string, val any) error
      GetAny(ctx context.Context, key string, val any) error
  }
```

## Recommended Implementation Approach

1. Memory Interface Addition - Add optional memory support to ClientConfig:
  type ClientConfig struct {
      // ... existing fields
      Memory kvs.Client // Optional KVS client for memory
  }

2. Session-Based Memory - Store conversation history by session ID:

- Key pattern: gollm:session:{sessionID}:messages
- Value: JSON-serialized message history
- Automatic cleanup with TTL (if supported by KVS implementation)

3. Memory Methods - Add methods to ChatClient:

```
  func (c *ChatClient) LoadConversation(ctx context.Context, sessionID string) ([]Message, error)
  func (c *ChatClient) SaveConversation(ctx context.Context, sessionID string, messages []Message) error
```

4. Provider Integration - Memory-aware completion methods that:

- Load existing conversation context
- Append new messages
- Save updated conversation
- Handle memory size limits automatically

## Key Benefits

- Provider Agnostic - Works with all existing LLM providers
- Optional Feature - Backwards compatible, no breaking changes
- Flexible Storage - Redis, DynamoDB, or any KVS implementation
- Session Management - Multi-user conversation tracking
- Memory Limits - Automatic conversation pruning (similar to conversation/main.go:100-103)

## Implementation Priority

The memory feature would integrate seamlessly with gollm's existing architecture without requiring changes to the core Provider interface maintaining the clean separation of concerns while adding powerful conversation persistence capabilities.

> Excellent! Please go ahead and implement this!

‚è∫ I'll implement the LLM memory functionality using the Sogo KVS interface. Let me create a comprehensive implementation plan and execute it.

‚è∫ Update Todos
  ‚éø ¬†‚òê Add Sogo KVS dependency to go.mod                   
     ‚òê Create memory.go with memory interface and types
     ‚òê Update ClientConfig to include optional Memory field
     ‚òê Add memory methods to ChatClient
     ‚òê Create memory-aware completion methods
     ‚òê Create example demonstrating memory functionality
     ‚òê Update README with memory documentation

## Summary

‚è∫ Perfect! I've successfully implemented LLM memory functionality for the gollm module. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

üéâ Implementation Complete!

‚úÖ Core Features Added:

1. Memory Management System (memory.go)
    - MemoryManager with configurable settings (max messages, TTL, key prefix)
    - Session-based conversation storage with automatic message limit management
    - Metadata support for conversations
    - System message preservation during pruning
2. Enhanced Client (client.go)
    - Optional memory integration via ClientConfig
    - Memory-aware completion methods: CreateChatCompletionWithMemory() and CreateChatCompletionStreamWithMemory()
    - Conversation management: Load, save, append, delete operations
    - Streaming support with memory persistence via memoryAwareStream
3. KVS Integration
    - Uses Sogo KVS interface for flexible backend support (Redis, DynamoDB, etc.)
    - JSON serialization for complex conversation data
    - Backwards compatible - existing code works unchanged
4. Comprehensive Example (examples/memory_demo/)
    - Interactive demo with session switching
    - Mock KVS implementation for testing
    - Multi-session conversation management
    - Real-world usage patterns
5. Documentation Updates
    - README enhanced with memory feature documentation
    - Code examples for all memory operations
    - Architecture diagram updated

üöÄ Key Benefits:

- Seamless Integration: Memory is optional and doesn't break existing code
- Provider Agnostic: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, and future providers
- Flexible Storage: Any KVS backend (Redis, DynamoDB, in-memory, custom)
- Smart Memory Management: Automatic conversation pruning with system message preservation
- Session-Based: Multi-user/multi-conversation support
- Streaming Compatible: Memory works with both regular and streaming completions

The implementation follows the existing gollm patterns and maintains the clean architecture while adding powerful conversation persistence capabilities!
